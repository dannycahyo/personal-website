Hi Guys! My name is Danny Dwi Cahyono, and I am a Front-End Engineer who was previously pursuing a Physical Education (Pendidikan Olahraga in Bahasa) degree at [Universitas Negeri Surabaya](https://www.unesa.ac.id/). My journey from a sports background to discovering my passion for programming has been an unexpected and exciting adventure ‚Äì one that has taught me that anyone can change careers, even if it means diving into a completely new field. And It's proven üòâ, I landed my first full-time job at [Ruangguru](https://www.ruangguru.com/) (the Largest EduTech Company in Southeast Asia) while still completing my last semester of college.

### Background Story: The Athletic Path

Growing up, I was a dedicated hockey indoor athlete üí™. I've already felt how the athlete lives, waking up early in the morning, going to the field for practice, isolating myself from exhausting TC (training center) for a couple of weeks and months, participating in competitions in various different areas and levels, and many more.

This passion for sports led me to pursue a Physical Education degree in college. As expected, I've gotten so much exposure to everything related to sports in college. Not only about Hockey but I've also been trying and practicing different kinds of sports, swimming, athletics, football, basketball, gymnastics, tennis, and many more. You named it üòè. Of course, at that time, I had no idea what coding looked like or how it could become an essential part of my life.

### Turning Point: Embracing Change

The COVID-19 pandemic changed everything, literally üôÉ. When classes shifted to an online format, I found it nearly impossible to engage in sports as I once had. The online learning experience for Physical Education was not as effective as I had hoped, and my interest started to wane. Searching for a new passion and a way to occupy my time during lockdown, I committed to learning about design for the very first time.

It wasn't long before I reconnected with an old friend who had just graduated from computer science college and working as a professional software engineer at a Startup named [M Nindra Zaka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mnindrazaka/). As we discussed his work, I found myself increasingly intrigued by the world of coding and software development. With his encouragement and guidance, I made the bold decision to learn how to code and explore the possibility of a career in software engineering.

In the following months, I poured my energy into learning the basics and fundamentals of programming. I was hooked üò±. I spent hours each day learning and practicing, and almost every single day I went to M Nindra Zaka's house.

### Proof of Commitment: Taking the Leap

A few weeks into my coding journey, my mentor (M Nindra Zaka) informed me that he would be moving back to Malang for work purposes and to engage with the fellow developer community there. I faced a tough decision: should I follow him to continue learning, despite the increased cost of living, or should I get back to my online college life and still stay in my home town Probolinggo?

After much consideration, I ultimately decided to take the leap and move with my mentor, knowing that the opportunity to learn and grow in software engineering was too valuable to pass up. So, I packed my bags and moved to Malang, determined to make the most of this new chapter in my life ü§ì.

### Deep Dive: Immersing Myself in the World of Coding

The move to Malang proved to be an excellent decision, as I was able to continue learning from my mentor daily and expand my knowledge from his roadmap through various online resources, such as YouTube videos, articles, and paid courses. I also became an active member of the local developer community, attending discussions, contributing to projects, and networking with fellow developers.

This involvement within the community led to an invitation to collaborate on a project with other talented developers. This experience not only helped me build my portfolio, but also allowed me to apply and refine the skills I had acquired through my self-taught coding journey.

### Landing an Internship: A New Beginning

With a robust portfolio of personal and community projects under my belt, I felt confident enough to apply for an internship at a software house in Malang called [Hash Rekayasa Teknologi](https://www.hash.id/). To my delight, I was accepted and eagerly began my new role in June 2021.

The first stage of my internship involved following a structured training program with learning materials and resources provided by the company. Soon after, I was assigned to work on internal applications, further enhancing my skills and knowledge in the field.

As I continued to excel in my work, I was invited to join another team working on a client project. My primary responsibility in this project was to revamp several pages of the client's website. This challenging yet rewarding experience confirmed my passion for software engineering and front-end development.

### Dive Deeper Into the Tech Industry: Embracing Innovation and Entrepreneurship

Upon completing my internship, I was eager to continue my growth in the tech industry. I enrolled in the [Digital Innovation & Entrepreneurship (DIGINOVE)](https://sites.google.com/staff.stei.itb.ac.id/mbkm/home) program ‚Äì a collaboration between [Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM)](https://kampusmerdeka.kemdikbud.go.id/) and Program Studi [Teknik Informatika & Sistem dan Teknologi Informasi Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika at Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://stei.itb.ac.id/). DIGINOVE aims to prepare students to build and launch innovative startups that address societal issues.

From the beginning of the program, I was exposed to the world of entrepreneurship and innovation, learning about the process of developing a startup from ideation to execution. Business Modal Canvas, Lean Startup, and Design Thinking are just some concepts I learned about during the program. And not only that, but we were also equipped with the knowledge of technology that makes scaleable startups possible, such as Cloud Computing, DevOps, and many more. As part of my participation in the program, I joined a team called Kompeten CO. There, I took on the role of a part-time Front End Engineer and learned invaluable skills in working within the startup ecosystem and developing projects from scratch.

### First Full-Time Job at Ruangguru: Expanding My Horizons

![First Full Time Job](https://res.cloudinary.com/du5jbmwz5/image/upload/v1686315537/First_Full_Time_Job_lw9buy.jpg)

Upon hearing about [Ruangguru Engineering Academy (REA)](https://rea.ruangguru.com/) from a friend, I eagerly applied to the program, which is designed to be similar to an internship. After following the selection and recruitment process till the end, I was disappointed to learn that my application had been rejected. However, this setback ultimately proved to be a blessing in disguise, as I was soon invited to participate in the full-time recruitment process. Perhaps I was deemed overqualified for an internship position, lol! üòÇ

After completing the interview process, I landed my first full-time job as a Software Engineer in January 2022. The opportunity to work at Ruangguru not only allowed me to expand my knowledge and skillset but also enabled me to make a meaningful impact on the lives of the users of the web apps I helped develop. Working collaboratively within a large team and assuming various roles, my career in software engineering continued to flourish, and my enthusiasm for the field grew stronger by the day üöÄ.

### Tech Winter Startup: Facing Setbacks and Staying Resilient

In the middle of 2022, the tech industry experienced a downturn known as "tech winter." As a result, I was laid off from my job in November 2022, which was an incredibly painful experience üòî. Refusing to let this setback derail my ambitions, I turned my focus toward honing my competitive programming skills on platforms like LeetCode and actively applying for full-time positions at various companies.

### Getting and Securing My Full-Time Job Again: Rising Above Challenges and Continuing to Learn

My perseverance paid off, and after numerous interviews with different companies, I found myself back in the Edutech industry, securing a position at [Gredu](https://www.gredu.asia/) in December 2022. As of the writing of this article, I continue to work at Gredu, developing and maintaining educational web apps that positively impact the lives of countless individuals.

### Conclusion: Embracing Change and the Power of Perseverance

My journey from a Physical Education student to a professional Software Engineer has been a roller coaster ride, full of unexpected twists and challenges. Through it all, I have learned valuable lessons that have shaped my personal growth and career development.
